### abstraccion

Abstraction is the process of hiding important information, showing only the most essential 
information. It reduces code complexity and isolates the impact of changes.
Abstraction can be understood from a real-life example: turning on a television must only 
require clicking on a button, as people don’t need to know or the process that it goes through.
Even though that process can be complex and important, there is no need for the user to know 
how it is implemented. The important information that isn’t required is hidden from the user, 
reducing code complexity, enhancing data hiding and reusability, thus making function 
blocks easier to implement and modify.
