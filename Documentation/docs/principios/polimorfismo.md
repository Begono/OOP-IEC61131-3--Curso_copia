### polimorfismo

The concept of polymorphism is derived by the combination of two words: Poly (Many) and 
Morphism (Form). It refactors ugly and complex switch cases/case statements.

Polymorphism allows an object to change its appearance and performance depending on the 
practical situation in order to be able to carry out a particular task [10]. It can be either static or 
dynamic: static polymorphism occurs when the objectâ€™s type is defined by the compiler; 
dynamic polymorphism occurs when the type is determined during run-time, making it possible 
for a same variable to access different objects while the program is running.
A good example to explain polymorphism is a Swiss Army Knife (Figure 2.4):
Figure 2.4 - Swiss Army Knife
A Swiss Army Knife is a single tool that includes a bunch of resources that can be used to solve
different issues. Selecting the proper tool, a Swiss Army Knife can be used to efficiently
perform a certain set of valuable tasks. In the dual way, a simple adder block that adapts itself 
to cope with, for instance, int, float, string, and time data types is an example of a polymorphic 
programming resource.
