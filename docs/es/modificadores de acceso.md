- PUBLIC: Corresponds to the specification of no access modifier
- PRIVATE: Access to the method is restricted to the function block or the program respectively.
- PROTECTED: Access to the method is restricted to the program or the function block and its derivatives respectively.
- INTERNAL: Access to the method is limited to the namespace (the library).
In addition to these access modifiers, you can manually add the FINAL modifier to a method:

- FINAL: Overwriting the method in a derivative of the function block is not allowed. This means that the method may not be overwritten/extended in a possibly existing subclass.
