### herencia

Inheritance allows the user to create classes based on other classes. The inherited classes can 
use the base class’s functionalities as well as some additional functionalities that the user may 
define. It eliminates redundant code, prevents copying and pasting and makes expansion easier. 
This is very useful because it allows classes to be extended of modified (overridden) without 
changing the base class’s code implementation.
What do an old landline phone and a smartphone have in common? Both of them can be 
classified as phones. Should they be classified as objects? No, as they also define the properties 
and behaviors of a group of objects. A smartphone works just like a regular phone, but it is also 
able to take pictures, navigate the internet, and do many other things. So, old landline phone
and smartphone are child classes that extend the parent phone class.
